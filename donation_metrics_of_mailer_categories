/*Key donation metrics of mailer campaign categories since 2018.

Campaign categories were manually assigned here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FRVhCEXS6M_olUHq1CeR_eAUnJmS0FYtGOO5x8KZfYk/edit?usp=sharing
then imported into the coc_reporting.ak_topdonationmailers_20182020_categories table.

The categories were determined by manually matching the mailer campaign name, subject line, or email body.
Many categories are issues (like Criminal Justice), but also include key themes of the mailer, such as if it featured Black
Mothers or referenced a big news event like Flint, MI.

Only the top 98 mailer's (since 2018) campaign tags were categorized, excluding the several EOY, Giving Tuesday, or 
otherwise solely fundraising based campaigns (all of which had multiple subject line themes).


This query also references this Donations table: https://platform.civisanalytics.com/spa/#/scripts/sql/107820843
