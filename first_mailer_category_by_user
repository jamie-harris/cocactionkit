/* Mailer category of users' first donation, first recurring donation, and latest donation.

Campaign categories were manually assigned here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FRVhCEXS6M_olUHq1CeR_eAUnJmS0FYtGOO5x8KZfYk/edit?usp=sharing
then imported into the coc_reporting.ak_topdonationmailers_20182020_categories table.

The categories were determined by manually matching the mailer campaign name, subject line, or email body.
Many categories are issues (like Criminal Justice), but also include key themes of the mailer, such as if it featured Black
Mothers or referenced a big news event like Flint, MI.

Only the top 98 mailer's (since 2018) campaign tags were categorized, excluding the several EOY, Giving Tuesday, or 
otherwise solely fundraising based campaigns (all of which had multiple subject line themes).


This query also references this Donations table: https://platform.civisanalytics.com/spa/#/scripts/sql/107820843
Created by Spence. Still being revised as of 18 FEB 2021.

/*The resulting table is optimized to compare categories by donation type (ie. "how many people first donated for 
a Criminal Justice mailer?", or "I want to pull a list of users who signed up for recurring donations on Elections mailers").
However, this means that one user will have multiple records with differing fields.

This table is NOT optimized to look at a single user and see what their first donation and latest donation was
in one row.*/
